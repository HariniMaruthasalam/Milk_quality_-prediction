# Milk_quality_-prediction
This repository contains the machine learning project and algorithm to predict the quality of the milk.
Milk is widely considered to be one of the most complete and nutritious 
foods in the world. The most consumed milk comes from cows, followed by 
buffaloes and small ruminants such as goats and sheep’s. Milk production 
is one of the most important sectors of the world’s agricultural industry. It 
also plays a key role in the economy of milk-producing countries. Due to 
the nutritive value of milk, its testing and quality control is an essential 
component of any milk processing industry whether small, medium or large 
scale. Milk is made up of 87% of water hence making it prone to adulteration 
by unscrupulous middlemen and unfaithful farmworkers. Good-quality raw 
milk has to be free of debris and sediment; free of off-flavors and abnormal 
color and odor; low in bacterial count; free of chemicals (e.g., antibiotics, 
detergents); and of normal composition and acidity. The quality of raw milk 
is the primary factor determining the quality of milk products. In this project 
we are going to check the quality of the milk using some parameters like PH 
level, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and color. And we also have 
an-another row which consists of grade or quality (high or low) through 
which we can predict the quality.
